# -Face-Type-Identifier

- A mini project with Machine Learning & Image Processing
- Built a Machine Learning Algorithm to identify the face type of a person in a live video feed using KNN Classifiers & Image Processing
- There were 6 different face types as Square, Oblong, Oval, Triangle, Round and Diamond
- K Nearest Neighbor Machine Learning Algorithm
- Used technologies : Python 3.6, OpenCV and other necessary python libraries (NumPy, pickle, â€ŽScikit-Learn, dlib and imutils)
- Text editors & IDEs : Python 3.6 64-bit IDLE
